=================================
CLOUD.OBJ
     One object to rule them all
=================================

- Import all the modules from cloud and forget about downloading, mantaining, etc.
- You just need one module on your local machine: Cloud.obj
- You can centralize your modules at your office, via intranet or in the cloud.


== Yes & No ==

- Yes, is like an RPC.
- Yes, it serializes objects.
- No, is not a webservice.
- No, it does not uses ZeroMQ or any other message queue framework (it is web-based)
- YES. It is that simple.


== But again, how? ==

Cloud.obj, as a server, just exposes modules.
Then, as a client, it maps them to urls, exposing classes, methods, properties.
Finally, you can use it and interact like any regular module!


== Give me some code! ==

# A simple, example

import cloud
o = cloud.Obj("http://localhost:5555/sys") # Now o is the module sys, from remote
print "The path is ", o.path
